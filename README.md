## Description 
#### 1st Challange:*Student-Grade-Generator*
This program enables one to the generate  grades of a student basing from his/her marks.

The marks are between 0 and 100,hence if there are any negative numbers or numbers above 100,the program would return a message stating that the grade is invalid.

The grades are assigned to the marks as shown below;

Grade  | Marks
A -      >79,
B -      60 to 79,
C -      49 to 59,
D -      40 to 49,
E -      less 40.

The Javascript file is connected to the HTML file for the purpose of prompting a user to input the Student's marks.

#### 2nd Challange:*speed-Detector*
In this program, the speed of a vehicle is measured.

If the speed is less than 70Km/Hr, 'Ok',is printed. When the speed exceeds 70Km/Hr, which is the critical speed,the driver is given a demerit point.

Exceedition of speed per 5Km/Hr earns a driver one demerit point.To calculate the demerit points one has to find the diffrance between the current speed and the critical speed.The diffrance is then divided by 5 soas to get the exact points.

So as to not get  decimals as our demeritpoints,we use Mathfloor, which rounds a number down to the nearest integer.

If the demerit points exceed 12 points, the driver's license is suspended.

#### 3rd Challange:*net-salary-calculator*
The major task of this program is to calculate an individual's Net Salary by collecting inputs of the user's basic salary and benefits.

The program also calculates the tax, NHIF deductions and Nssf deductions.

To calculate the net salary, the NHIF deduction,NSSF Deduction and tax must be subtracted from the gross salary.
